        <h2>Scott Pilgrim book redesigns</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
              This project had to of been one of my favorites of the program. I had been super into the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels and when I heard that we had to do a project where we need to design/redesign book covers, I just knew I had to make new designs for those graphic novels. I made 3 designs covers for the first 3 volumes. </p>
          <p>
              I made designs for the front and back covers. The Scott Pilgrim graphic novels has many different cover iterations so It was a little challenging to make something different yet not to separate. But I think I was successful in making something unique and distinct that doesnâ€™t branch of the main designs from previous official covers.
