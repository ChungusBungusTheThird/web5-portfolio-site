            <h1>Scott Pilgrim book redesigns</h1>
            <p>
              This project had to of been one of my favorites of the program. I had been super into the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels and when I heard that we had to do a project where we need to design/redesign book covers, I just knew I had to make new designs for those graphic novels. I made 3 designs covers for the first 3 volumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made designs for the front and back covers. The Scott Pilgrim graphic novels has many different cover iterations so It was a little challenging to make something different yet not to separate. But I think I was successful in making something unique and distinct that doesnâ€™t branch of the main designs from previous official covers.

          <h2>Front and back cover concept sketches</h2>
          <p>Here are the many sketch ideas I had in mind when redesigning the covers. I wanted to create a cover illustration that shows off an important part in the story. So I sketched out 3 variations each of the first 3 books and chose the one that I think works best. The back covers are also important moments that happen in the story so I wanted to add those as well.</p>

          <h2>Final book Redesigns</h2>
          <p>
            Here are the final designs of the first 3 Volumes of the Scott Pilgrim graphic novels. First being when Scott meets Ramona, the girl of his dreams and Knives Chau being in love with Scott at the same time. Second being Knives being angry at Ramona for "stealing" Scott away from here and Knives expressing her love towards Scott. And third being Envy Addams performing at her concert, while Scott and Ramona watch in disgust.
