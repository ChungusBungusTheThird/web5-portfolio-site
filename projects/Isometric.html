          <h1>Captain Toad's little quest</h1>
          <p>
            In my illustration class during my third semester, we were tasked to create an isometric illustration on paper and then design it in Adobe Illustrator. We did a few exercises and it was pretty fun!
          </p>
          <p>
            There is this game called Captain Toad Treasure Tracker on the Wii U and Nintendo Switch that I played a long time ago, so I wanted to base one of my illustrations on it. This game is very inspirational to me with its cute theme, incorporating game mechanics like the hillslopes, Green stars, gold coins, and shy guy enemies. The effort then put on to my Captain Toad design made it a joy to truly feel like you are playing a video game.

          <p>
            The final result of the digital illustration. I ended up making the level more bigger and added some flowers, coins, Green stars, Shy Guys and some pixel UI elements to make it look straight out of a video game!
