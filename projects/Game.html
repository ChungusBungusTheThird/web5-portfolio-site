            <h1>Lucky The Rabbit Game</h1>
            <p>
              Lucky the Rabbit is a game made by me, Felipe, and Merari in our Web 3 course. You play as Lucky, collecting as many fruits as possible and delivering them in the basket. 
              There are trees and rotten fruit on the field, so be careful! Avoid colliding with trees and rotten fruit that can damage you by running into trees. 
              There is a shining carrot that can spawn and once consumed, Lucky gets a speed boost!
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of the game started off by me sketching out a little bunny character in my notebook. 
              I then tried expanding the idea and making character game assets and showing them to my teammates. 
              I was in charge of making the game assets.

          <h2>Official Logo Design</h2>
          <p>
            This is the logo I made in Illustrator. I matched the colors to look more like the main character Lucky. 
            I made the letter "Y" look like the ears of Lucky and the letter "I" is replaced by the carrot power-up in the game.

          <h2>Old Box art</h2>
          <p>
            This is the original box artwork I made for the game. The background looks a little sloppy so I had to change it eventually

          <h2>Updated box art</h2>
          <p>
            And Eventually I did! This is the updated box artwork I made for the game. The only change was the background to look more like how It looks in gameplay.

          <h2>Power up and taking damage portrait</h2>
          <p>
            These are actually the first drawings I made for the game. I had the idea of getting a power up and making it so Lucky's appearance changing slightly and also when he takes some damage. These illustrations appear as portraits in game next to your health points.

          <h2>Lucky spritesheet</h2>
          <p>
            This is the spritesheet I made in Illustrator then put it in photoshop. If you play the game you might notice that in this spritesheet, there is a victory animation. Sadly this didn't make it in the final cut due to time constraints.

          <h2>Talking character portraits</h2>
          <p>
            These were some character portraits and some other random drawings of Lucky the Rabbit. Just to get the look and feel of how he is as a character with his silly expressions.

        <div class="illustration">
          <h2>More character art</h2>
          <p>
            These are just some more character artwork I drew up. You might notice that there are 2 other characters. The fox is called Yoink and the Raccon is called Ragoon. These are scarpped enemies for the game due to time constraints. I did make some spritesheets for them but we didn't have time to implement them sadly. Maybe in a future update.

          <h2>Game over screen</h2>
          <p>
            When you take more than 3 hits of damage, you get a game over. This is the game over screen I drew up. The big "GAME OVER" text crushing Lucky.

          <p>
            Take control of the rabbit himself and collect as many fruit as possible before the timer runs out!
