                  Lucky the Rabbit is a game made by me, Felipe and Merari in our Web 3 course. You play as Lucky, collecting as many fruit as possible and delivering them in the basket. There are trees and rotten fruit on the field so as the player, you must avoid collecting these rotten fruit and taking damage by running into trees. There is a shining carrot that can spawn and once consumed, Lucky gets a speed boost! 
                  <p>
                      The idea of the game started off by me sketching out a little bunny character in my notebook. I then tried expanding the idea and mechanics of the game and show them to my teammates. I was in charge of making the game assets. 
  
                      Concept art and assets are seen bellow...

          <h4>Official Logo</h4>
          <p>This is the logo I made in Illustrator. I made the colors look more like the main character Lucky. I made the letter "Y" look like the ears of Lucky and the letter "I" is replaced by the carrot power up in the game.</p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Game logo-01.jpg" alt="" />
          <h4>Old Box art</h4>
          <p>This is the original box artwork I made for the game. The background looks a little sloppy so I had to change it eventually</p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Old Lucky the rabbit cover.png" alt="" />
          <h4>Updated Box art</h4>
          <p>And Eventually I did! This is the updated box artwork I made for the game. The only change was the background to look more like how It looks in gameplay.</p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Lucky_Rabbit_Box_art.png" alt="" />
          <h4>Power up and taking Damage </h4>
          <p>These are actually the first drawings I made for the game. I had the idea of getting a power up and making it so Lucky's appearance changing slightly and also when he takes some damage. These illustrations appear as portraits in game next to your health points. </p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Game power up and taking damage-01.jpg" alt="" />
          <h4>Lucky Spritesheet</h4>
          <p>This is the spritesheet I made in Illustrator then put it in photoshop. If you play the game you might notice that in this spritesheet, there is a victory animation. Sadly this didn't make it in the final cut due to time constraints.</p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Game Lucky spritesheet-01.jpg" alt="" />
          <h4>Talking cutscene portraits</h4>
          <p>These were some character portraits and some other random drawings of Lucky the Rabbit. Just to get the look and feel of how he is as a character with his silly expressions</p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Game Lucky portraits-01.jpg" alt="" />
          <h4>More character art</h4>
          <p>These are just some more character artwork I drew up. You might notice that there are 2 other characters. The fox is called Yoink and the Raccon is called Ragoon. These are scarpped enemies for the game due to time constraints. I did make some spritesheets for them but we didn't have time to implement them sadly. Maybe in a future update. </p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Game characters-03.jpg" alt="" />
          <h4>Game Over screen</h4>
          <p>When you take more than 3 hits of damage, you get a game over. This is the game over screen I drew up. The big "GAME OVER" text crushing Lucky. </p>
          <img class="reveal" src="./imgs/Game Over screen-02.jpg" alt="" />
