            <p>
              Just like my isometric project from before, in my illustration class during my third semester, we were tasked to create a 3 Point Perspective illustration on paper and then design it on Adobe Illustrator. 
              We did a few exercises and it was honestly pretty challenging. I kind of struggled a bit but it was good practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this 3 point perspective design, I decided to draw a city with many buildings. After drawing it on paper, I felt like something was missing, so I added a character sitting on the edge of the rooftop to add some charm to the drawing. I also snuck in a little secret in one of the building windows haha.

          <h2>Final Illustration Design</h2>
          <p>
            This is the final result! I made this illustration in Illustrator. 
            The colors of the sky is a purple and pink gradient, and I like the touch of the blue outline of the buildings. 
            It looks pretty one-to-one to the sketch, but I did add in a little secret in one of the buildings.
