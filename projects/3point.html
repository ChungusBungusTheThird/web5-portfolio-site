            Just like my Isometric project from before, In my Illustration class during my third semester, we were tasked to create an 3 Point perspective illustration on paper and then design it on Adobe illustrator. We did a few exercises and it was honestly pretty challenging. I kind of struggled a bit but It was good practice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For this 3 point perspective design, I decided to draw a city with many buildings. After drawing it on paper, I felt like something was missing so I added a character sitting on the edge of the rooftop to add some charm to the drawing. I also snuck in a little secret in one of the building windows haha.
