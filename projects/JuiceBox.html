            <h1>Yoshi fruit juiceboxes</h1>
            <p>
              From my first semester, this one had to of been my favorite project in my Graphic design 1 class. It was our last project assignment and I had to use all the skills I've learned in Illustrator to the test!
            </p>
            <p>
              We had to make 3 Juice box designs and only print out 1. But since I liked my designs so much I printed all 3 of them. I made Yoshi fruit themed juice box designs with 3 different colored Yoshis and 3 flavor juices.
            </p>

          <h2>The final Yoshi fruit juice box designs</h2>
          <p>These are the final designs of the juice boxes. Instead of using the same green yoshi, I wanted to add different colors Yoshis that go with a fruit flavour. Note, I didn't make them the same color as the fruit they are assigned with because I feel like the box would be focused to much one 1 color so I wanted to make a color contrast with the yoshi and the fruit so It would pop more.</p>
